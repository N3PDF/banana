While benchmarking different codes, it comes useful to have at hand a series of
tools that allows to compare them in the most granular way, but being compatible

That is why the tools that we developed for this purpose are collected here, for
current and later use, and packaged together with the rest of `banana` into an
easy to install PyPI package.
