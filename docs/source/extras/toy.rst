ToyLH PDF
=========

A pure Python ToyLH PDF compliant implementation, with an |LHAPDF| compatible
interface.

.. note::

  This implementation is not powered by the |LHAPDF| library, so it does not
  require it's installation, even if the interface is made such that the
  resulting PDF object can be used in any place in which an |LHAPDF| could be
  used.
